    <p class="paragraph" alt="what are you doing here - you already stole my cookies">
        Update contains: New features - Partner Panel & Pages, Mobile Support, New Menu - new flavours to try, oh wait. <br />Fixes: CSS unused scripts, Log-Ins removed,
        Mobile site view, Incorrect Cookies - i told you not to steal my cookies %¡(£! >:( <br /> <br />

        In this build we added a new partner panel and seperate partner pages specifically designed and chosen by the partners
        themselves. Their background, description, name and social medias displayed in all one page. If you would like to be
        displayed on these pages and want your own, please let us <a href="https://www.twitter.com/UKcbtec" target="_blank">know.</a>
        The partners are celebrated on the front page of the website. If we get enough partners to participate - we will add a
        varying ticker on the front page, updating each hour with a new partner. <br /><br />

        Aside from partners we also updated the menu system. It is now a much more cleaner version - instead of the home button
        you can now just click the logo. It also includes drop down menus and a brand new hamburger menu for mobile (if you don't
        know what that is, it's basically a menu that has the design of 3 horizontal lines that has to be clicked to view
        it's contents.) <br /><br />

        We also fixed (finally) mobile versions. The site is no-longer broken on mobile and provides a clean experience. The lucky
        mobile users get a seperate page from desktop (a slightly simpler version with that hamburger menu.) without side ways scrolling
        which was an annoying issue from the site launch due to our old menu system.<br /><br />

        Again, we had to remove some features we initially planned. The log-in system was far to many resources than we first
        imagined and it didn't suit the small demand we had for it. Newsletters was also a miss. We do still offer a newsletter
        you just have to contact us on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/UKcbtec">twitter</a> to be put on the list. <br /><br />


    </p>

    <center><h2 class="subhead">292090d - (MAJOR)</h2></center>

    <p class="paragraph">
        In this build we added a cookie consent banner that actually works avoid user annoyance, improve usability and
        transparency.
        We also added a change log, which is what you are reading right now, a fitting background to the Downchkr page
        to suit the style of the service and to match the logo and banner, along with icons on the homepage for links now.
        One last thing relating to backgrounds, we also improved the backgrounds on other pages to improve them to suit the
        style of the pages. We added a loading screen to hide the funky elements when loading a page like Downchkr. Finally,
        we added a custom, clean scroll bar instead of an annoying, distracting default one. With the loading screen update,
        we also added some animations to elements when they update. Overall this update was generally display improvements
        and bug fixes. We hope to do more bug fixes and improvements in great deal like we did in this very recent update.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="paragraph">
        We had to fix a few mishaps we happened to create while developing the site. These include fixing the margins
        for tablets (We will fix mobile in the next update). Removed dead-links (such as services we do not use anymore)
        and updated the incorrect page title of Downchkr displaying "Home" instead of the correct title "Downchkr".
        One last thing from me, next update I will add light mode for the people who are longing for it so much and other
        improvements and bug fixes.
    </p>
    <br /><br /><br />
    <center><h2 class="subhead">612d024</h2></center>

    <p class="paragraph">
        In this build we added a small update to the CSS script (The script that makes the design of the site as
        colourful as it is). We added the twitter timeline to Downchkr and created the page. We also created a secondary
        styling class which is used for other text styles.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="paragraph">
        We had to fix the animation that occurs on the menu when selecting an item (The little red bar you see under
        a button on the menu).
    </p>
    <br /><br /><br />
    <center><h2 class="subhead">e93b112 - (SEMI-MAJOR)</h2></center>

    <p class="paragraph">
        In this build we added a 503 error page as a fail safe for when our server isn't responding to your request
        and gives you an insight on what is actually going on with the site.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="paragraph">
        In this build, we didn't fix any bugs.
